##Bugs
- Navigation in this virtual environment on code academy is painful. You can't type commands without it whining at you which requires you to click the mouse to get back to your keyboard only interface and that's just maddening!
- the alt+> keyboard shortcut is broken while working in the virtual console
- [on this page](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/command-line-manipulation/exercises/wildcards-command-line-manipulation) Step 3, the correct command `cp *.txt satire/` is considered to be an error, because they want you to use just a * which will return errors on directories.
##Thoughts
So far this lesson program seems really heavy handed with repetition of what seems to be very straightforward concepts. The hardest part for this even for beginniners is remembering what command should be used.
the automatic checking if you typed in the commands perfectly with their expectations is obnoxious. I don't understand why they give you a prompt without the current working directory.

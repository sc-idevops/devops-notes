#Project Notes for learning GIT
##Basics
###Git add
stages a file
###git commit
saves a file in the repo

##Branching
###branch
can only list, create, or delete branches.
###checkout
switches between branches, or restores a file. 
__checkout --__ indicates you want to restore a file from HEAD

##Working Remotely
###Fetch vs Pull
Fetch gets commits from the remote but doesnt merge
Pull gets commits from the remote and merges them for you.

##Collaboration
###Git Rebase
Rebasing is scary. Your project manager will kill you if you do it wrong. Be careful. 
Only do it locally, do not rebase after code has been pushed.

##Configuration
###Git Ignore File
this file keeps track line by line what files and folders you go not want git to track in a directory

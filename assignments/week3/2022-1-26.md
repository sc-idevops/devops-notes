#BEHOLD: PYTHON!
Today: building an API rest server in Python
*flask is a python webserver*
`pip install flask`
`conda install flask`

##Hello World
`from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

//call the function
app.run(parameters)`

**parameters are defined elsewhere and indicates what can go in there**

###Routes
The webserver once started will be watching for a HTTP request.
Routes indicate what comes after your ip. "hello" for example would be 127.0.0.1/hello

##Functions
(you should always functionize any code that repeats)
Python is tab based, so indentation is important! Functions are defined by indentation

#Managing Data: SQLITE
we're gonna use a database to manage this. a local database is easier to use **sqlite**
##EndPoints and Connections
establishing a connection means opening the file to be able to read/write to it

##Cursor
This "cursor" is what does your queries to the database
these queries are one long string that gets passed. thats why the CREATE TABLE code is in triple ""
remember databases must have a primary key. 
|column name|data type|special flags|
  *special flags are like, primary key, or cannot be empty, has to be unique*

once you establish what the cursor is going to do, call execute on that cursor to commit that action to the database

##Inserting Data
web urls often have stuff that comes after a ? which indicates parameters
its one long string that's delimited by &'s
a web request returns headers, a lot of information including those parameters

these parameters end up as a python dictionary (key value pairs)
keys are referenced by '{}'s

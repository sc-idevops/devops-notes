# Explaining Automation

Automation is really anything we do more than once should be automated.
This translates to the automation of the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

## Automating the SDLC

This can be broken down into 3 types:

### Infrastructure Building

Create the infrastructure in a repeatable way using infrastructre as code.

### Pipelines

Deploy the software onto the infrastrucutre you just provisioned.

### Operations

Maintain and monitor the software we've deployed. 
This could be anything from scripts that get triggered from the monitoring platform to 
performing healing actions against broken services in a automated fashion, to user creation and deletion, 
to operations and audit reports for compliance ceritifications.


The overall goal is to use automation to create repeatability, consistency, and save time.

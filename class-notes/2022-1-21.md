##Bash Functions
function-name() {
  echo "your commands"

}

just call the function by name when you want to use it

its recommended to echo variables at some point in the script to help with debugging and so the user can follow along with the script's workings

##Passing Values to Bash Functions

values are numerical and positional. $1, $2, just like parameters for the script
